# My First Repository 
* 👋 Hi, I’m @TinayeSC 
* 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, computer vision, automation with regards to control, computationl neuroscience, human-computer interaction, among other things. This repository contains many of my first ever uses of modules, languages, and techniques. I use this repository to remind myself whenever I forget a topic or technique. 
* 🌱 I’m currently applying for Computer Science through UCAS, and to other European Universities.
* 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any fun projects that I can use to further my skills and learn new things.
