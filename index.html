	<p> <b>Bio:</b> I grew up in Zimbabwe and through exposure to science fiction, I developed an interest in the sciences. Living in such a poor country, there was rarely stable internet connections. As a result, when the opportunity arrived to play around on the internet I took full advantage. I learnt how to do many things online and even learnt how to play Chess from the computer. 
<br>
I always saw science as a means to improve the quality of life around me. Presently, Computer Science is my passion. I hope to become apt enough to apply Computer Science to optimise and improve aspects of the country. Through this, I hope to gain enough experience to enter more advanced areas; such as aiding in the design and programming of space systems, satellites, and rovers.<p>
